## Overview
In this study, we address the key objective of identifying the optimal region within an extensive geographical area for strategic billboard placement, ensuring effective communication with diverse audiences. Our proposed framework integrates an enhanced UNet model with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention method to optimize the identification process based on satellite data. Comparative evaluations against alternative deep learning models, utilizing various metrics, underscore the efficacy of our approach.
